The tone should feel human and spontaneous, capturing emotions, thoughts, and small details that bring the story to life. Avoid a robotic, formulaic approach; instead, let the story unfold naturally, with a conversational flow and realistic pauses or reflections. This is about creating a vivid, relatable experience, not just recounting eventsâ€”focus on immersing the listener in the storyteller's world
